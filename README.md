# Pokedex Exercises Solution

Solution to the Pokedex exercises in the [Code Your Future React syllabus](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/react/index).

There is a branch that contains the solution for each exercise. So in other words, the [`week-1-exercise-d`](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/react-pokedex-exercises-solution/tree/week-1-exercise-d) contains the code after Exercise D of Week 1.

If a student is stuck because they have not completed a previous exercise, you can "catch them up" by wwitch to the branch before the current exercise (press "W" to open the switcher).

You can then copy/paste the relevant code and send it to the student.

Or send the complete project by clicking the green "Code" button and downloading the zip for this branch. Then send the zip to the student and provide instructions on unzipping the code and running `npm install`.
